Minishell is a Unix-based project at 42 aimed at building a functional, minimalistic shell. This project involves creating a command-line interface that parses and executes user commands, handles environment variables, and implements basic shell behaviors, mimicking a subset of a real shell.

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Parse and execute commands with arguments and options
- Manage processes using fork(), execve(), and pipes for command chaining
- Handle environment variables and implement built-in commands like cd, echo, and exit
- Work with signals to handle interrupts and manage process behavior

This was a team project with jcummins42p (https://github.com/jcummins42p).
